title: "Now with the power of LuaJIT"
---

Two updates in two days? Wow.

This is a switch I have been planning for a while, but now that [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) has gained awesome [FFI](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.lua.general/74072) abilities, it just seemed like the right time.

Brat now ships with LuaJIT instead of standard Lua and readline has been replaced with the much smaller and simpler [linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/). The main difference you are likely to notice is the incredible speed increase (because of LuaJIT, not linenoise):

examples/tak.brat

    Lua:
    10.45 user 0.05 system 0:10.51 elapsed

    LuaJIT:
    3.55 user 0.01 system 0:03.73 elapsed


examples/fibonacci.brat

    Lua:
    2.43 user 0.02 system 0:02.58 elapsed

    LuaJIT:
    0.83 user 0.01 system 0:00.88 elapsed


examples/tree.brat

    Lua:
    15.97 user 0.04 system 0:16.11 elapsed

    LuaJIT:
    6.71 user 0.05 system 0:06.82 elapsed


examples/rosetta_code/hailstone.brat

    Lua:
    397.99 user 0.19 system 6:42.22 elapsed

    LuaJIT:
    153.18 user 0.49 system 2:35.09 elapsed


If anyone runs into issues on OS X, please let me know. I'm flying blind when it comes to updating the OSX build stuff.
