#summary Command line options

= Usage =

All you really need to do is give Brat the name of the file you want to run:

`brat [options] [file_name]`

= Options =

However, Brat comes with several command line options with which to confuse you.

  * `-a` -  Forces recompilation of parser, internal code, core code, and your code.
  * `-f` -  Ignores any existing bytecode for your file and compiles it from scratch
  * `-h` -  Shows help, much like this
  * `-i` -  Interactive Brat shell
  * `-k` -  Keeps the intermediate '.neko' file which is generated
  * `-s` -  Create a standalone executable
  * `-t` -  Show how much time is taken to do all this
  * `-z` -  Reads in Brat code from the standard input and then spits out Neko code (this is for interactive mode, I doubt you need it otherwise).

= Notes =
`-k` implies `-f`

`-s` is not working (yet).
