Brat is a little toy language that _just doesn't care_.

## Why You Should Use Brat

An arbitrary number of reasons to use Brat:
  
1. Plenty of [sharp knives](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ruby/msg/f005724cd8961f4b)
2. [No rigid class hierarchies](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/)
3. No classes at all
4. No pointless restrictions, only pointful ones
5. [No keywords to learn](http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/keywords/start "C++ Keywords")
6. No one is going to tell you 'no'
7. No one else is

* You don't have a thing to prove
